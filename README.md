# MLTerror15
Deeply learned simulator for Orange Tiny Terror with Recurrent Neural Networks

Uses [RTNeural](https://github.com/jatinchowdhury18/RTNeural) for fast inferencing and model parsing.

## Windows Compilation
1. ```cmake -B out\\build .```
You can replace ```out\\build``` with whatever path you wish to use for the project files generated by CMake.
2. ```cmake --build out\build --config Release``` 
```Release``` can be replaced with whatever build configuration you have setup. The other useful one default is `Debug`, but you can create others.
